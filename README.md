# Zen Focus App 
## An App for students, made by a student 🧘
This app helps you configure deep work or study sessions, actively blocking distractions and tracking how you spend your time, allowing you to take control of your productivity.

### ✨ Key Features (The Vision)
Configurable Focus Sessions: Start a session by defining what you are going to study or what project you are working on.

- **Time Management:** Choose whether you want a continuous session (e.g., 60 minutes) or work in blocks (e.g., 4 Pomodoros of 25 min).
- **Distraction Blocker:** Create lists of applications and websites that will be blocked during your focus session.
- **The Focus Guardian:** If you try to access a blocked site or app, ZenFocus will stop you with custom notifications.
- **Progress Tracking:** Get a history of your sessions to know how many real hours you have invested in each subject or project.
